His role is to help you building and maintaining an automated Software factory by integrating several tools together,
implemented with the 'Infrastructure as Code' idea.

For details on Forjj, visit https://github.com/forj-oss/forjj

'Infrastructure as Code' is part of DevOps (automation). FORJJ can help you create/update/maintain your DevOps solution.
But FORJJ is not DevOps if you do not help your teams to do DevOps (DevOps Culture).
